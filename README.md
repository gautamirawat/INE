# INE
I have tried and implemented the structure required for task 2 of the assesment. I have created a serverless web application using AWS services. The project includes html files index and error. The index file constitutes the basic layout. I have created the required table in dynamoDB with 5 entry items. As i had no previous experince working on such a project all the things done are within a day's time that is learning it from scratch and the deployment. I have integrated the API gateway nd also added the relevnt dynamoDB policy. I created the lambda file, I was able to fetch details within the console but not on the web application. Also after the entire implementation I came across the fact that S3 is just another form of database. It helps in storing the inputs into the dynamoDB table and with that we can return responses as text messages. I surely found a way out to complete the task but I have no more time left to try and test it so sending in the work that has been done with my best shot and best potential.
